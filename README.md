This version of LunarLander has a crude swipe control added for changing the amount of thrust and direction.   Swiping up will activate the rockets.   Swiping down will turn them off.   Swiping right will direct the rocket to the right.   Swiping left will direct the rocket to the left.

A trivial mode was also added which increases the available fuel resources more than the easy mode.    There is also an Autopilot mode which will use a heuristic to attempt to successfully land the rocket.
